Registered Hypotheses:
 - Menu interactions:
    - Laser pointer is the most efficient for skilled users
      - Minimal hand movement (all in the wrist)
      - More precise selections
    - Touch is easier for less skilled users
      - Broader movements lead to less mistakes
 - Menu placement: 
    - Menus should be reachable if interactable by touch
    - Menus should be in clear sight
    - Users do not like head mounted menus
    - Hand mounted menus allow for more stability (less mistakes)
      - Both arms can be used to work toward the same action
 - Movement:
    - Teleporting is the movement method that causes the least sickness (most comfortable)
